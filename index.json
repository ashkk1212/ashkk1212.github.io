There are many problems where computer scientists employ interesting algorithms to solve them. One such problem which is often seen in real life is the problem of Optimal Stopping.\nAlso known as The Secretary problem (GFG article on the same- here), say youâ€™re interviewing a group of applicants for a position, how do you maximize the chances of hiring the single best applicant in the pool? (Once a candidate is rejected, they are gone forever and cannot be recalled.)\nInterestingly the dating variant of the problem asks how many people should you date before truly finding the one or deciding to settle down with? Tricky question but surprisingly probability has an answer for this- \\(\\dfrac{1}{e} \\) or approximately 37%.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you want to date \\( n\\) people (idk how you\u0026rsquo;d do that though) First date \\( \\dfrac{n}{e}\\) without commiting to anyone of them, (here e is the base of the natural logarithm) And then ask the rest, one by one Now select the person outranking the candidates you\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far Thus maximizing the probability of going out with the best person Marry that person, \u0026lsquo;cause they are the best match for you (according to probability) By the way, do check out The 37% Rule verse by Ernest Davis. Man\u0026rsquo;s got an enitre page of his amazing verses here- Verses for the Information Age (found this awesome piece of literature accidentally)\nWon\u0026rsquo;t be going into details of this thing but you can check out this for a proof, or this paper for a more detailed historical outlook to the problem.\n","date":"15 May 2022","permalink":"/til/37percent/","section":"Today I Learned","summary":"An algorithm which answers the ages old question- is he/she the right one for me?","title":"The 37% Rule"},{"content":" So, you thought wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s the god wiki?

This can lead to incorrect conclusions.\nI did not realize it until I heard this thing from a friend. In layman terms- we tend to compare our present with the things that made their way in the past, completely ignoring the things which didn\u0026rsquo;t.

Original problem statement file and required files here. This problem was given to me in my sophomore year as a task under my tenure in the ARK perception team.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t done robotics in a long while (am writing this thing after leaving all that stuff behind), this being the only testimony of me having done those courses on image processing lol.\nProblem Statement # If none of the following make sense to you and those text files seem like random jargon, this post is NOT for you. Go and move on, you\u0026rsquo;re better off not knowing about all this altogether (unless you want to pursue a career in robotics, maybe)\nA breif version of the problem goes like this-\ngiven 30 files, 10 each of types 0 (RGB, jpg), 1 (Segmentation, jpg) and 2 (Pose, txt) images are 256x144 in size a projective pinhole camera is used everywhere camera has a horizontal field-of-view (FOV) of 90Â° assumptions- the distortion parameters are zero principal point of the image is at its center focal length in x direction = focal length in y direction pose data is the position of the camera in the world coordinates in the NED coordinate system it is stored in the form of an orientation quaternion and a position vector Objective # Using the information provided, calculate\nlength of the side of the cube x,y,z coordinates of the centroid of the cube WARNING: Proceed ahead only after you\u0026rsquo;re ready for the solution (after giving the problem some thought) and are already familiar with the basics of image processing and Computer Vision Initial Attempt # I started to recall everything that I\u0026rsquo;d gone through while doing my courses. Thought about applying all sorts of stuff like homography, constructing the camera matrices, using stereo pairs (seemed illogical at that time).\nMy line of thought only seemed to go in one direction- use all images separately.\nBut then I hit a dead wall when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t convert the 2D coordiantes to 3D ones (was the essence of the entire problem). I thought maybe the information given was insufficient and I needed a scale factor.\nThe whole 3D -\u0026gt; 2D conversion eats up the depth information completely, hence a (x y z) -\u0026gt; (x\u0026rsquo; y\u0026rsquo;) mapping exists. However to do the opposite, you need to materialize the depth information from somewhere.\nBut then again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using all the information provided to me, hinting towards my shortcoming.\nMy solution approach # Get em curves, ehm corners # I started to think of some use case to the segmentation masks provided. I had to locate corners in tha image according to image coordiantes. So there it was, I used the segmentation masks, ran them through the Harris corner detector function of OpenCV.\nThe results were good honestly,\nbut\nHmm, but hey I had many coresponding points atleast.\n2D -\u0026gt; 3D # There are a few ways in which you can achieve this. The simplest being tracing out lights rays from the corners to the center of the camera (possible with the given pose data) and then finding the intersection.\nBut then this method is bound to introduce noise. You\u0026rsquo;ll never be sure about the intersection at all. In fact you might even will have to find the point of minimum distance instead. Because, in robotics, error and noise are gonna be your arch nemesis always. Consequenty, a large part of your time will often be invested with dealing with the error.\nI had to use Triangulation. All what remained was to simulate the thing1 on the actual problem.\nEvil matrices # The key step behind all of this to work appreciably was- not screwing up simple calculation. Simple, right?\nFunnily enough, I managed to screw up the calculation each time I made the extrinsic and intrisic matrices. Why? Because the best values I could come up with were-\n55.75492842884244 66.53124150897686 73.18385840990788 9.655399061410336 These are supposed to be side lenghts of the cube ðŸ¤¡. Another run of the simulation yielded side lenghts of the order of 10^-3 to 10^3 (in the same set ðŸ¤¡ ðŸ¤¡).\nMy best guess to where I was going wrong back then would be direction of axes and the position of the 2D origin (I don\u0026rsquo;t remember, even if I did, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t reveal it like that ofc) But then I also remember checking my camera parameters like for the N^th time.\nI even tried plotting the 3D coordinates after tweaking the paramteres like a bazillion times, only to get this\nThis, well this is supposed to be a face of te cube, which should be, idk, slightly squarish I guess? (Even the ground corner coordinates didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to go along the NED direction thing)\nDouble checked it with my peers at ARK, asked the seniors about the validity of pose data only to hit a dead end.\nResult # There were no results, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t solve it.\nHowever after this thing was over and we were discussing about it, turns out one of us at ARK did indeed manage to get a very tight approximate.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just quote the solution algorithm he followed here.\nML and approximation # ML algorithms in their core are essentially complex approximation methods. Interestingly we can apply a well known method to get to the solution here.\nGradient descent, get a parametric equation for the original complicated equation and bam a very clean solution.\nComing diretly from his repo\u0026rsquo;s README.md\nThe final approach was to create a parametric model for a cube in 3D space lying on a horizontal surface. Such a cube is sufficiently described by 5 parameters - the x, y, z coordinates of its centroid, the angle of rotation about the vertical (z-axis), and the side length. The parameterization used has s as the semi side length for a cleaner formula representation. The corners of this cube can be found in terms of these parameters and keys/color descriptors can be assigned in cyclic order. These keys were manually assigned, although it is possible to automatically assign them using the detected color data. With this description, the distance of each corner can be found to all the corresponding projection lines and the sum of the squares of these distances is taken as a loss function. Tensorflow is then used to automatically differentiate and optimize the values of these parameters using the Adam optimizer.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the link to his repo\nTriangulation, 16-385 Computer Vision, Spring 2020\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"5 March 2022","permalink":"/blog/cv-task/","section":"Blog","summary":"An interesting Computer Vision problem with all my approaches and an elegant solution.","title":"A Computer Vision Problem"},{"content":" Getting things done while procrastinating.
