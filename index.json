There are many problems where computer scientists employ interesting algorithms to solve them. One such problem which is often seen in real life is the problem of Optimal Stopping.\nAlso known as The Secretary problem (GFG article on the same- here), say you’re interviewing a group of applicants for a position, how do you maximize the chances of hiring the single best applicant in the pool? (Once a candidate is rejected, they are gone forever and cannot be recalled.)\nInterestingly the dating variant of the problem asks how many people should you date before truly finding the one or deciding to settle down with? Tricky question but surprisingly probability has an answer for this- \\(\\dfrac{1}{e} \\) or approximately 37%.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you want to date \\( n\\) people (idk how you\u0026rsquo;d do that though) First date \\( \\dfrac{n}{e}\\) without commiting to anyone of them, (here e is the base of the natural logarithm) And then ask the rest, one by one Now select the person outranking the candidates you\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far Thus maximizing the probability of going out with the best person Marry that person, \u0026lsquo;cause they are the best match for you (according to probability) By the way, do check out The 37% Rule verse by Ernest Davis. Man\u0026rsquo;s got an enitre page of his amazing verses here- Verses for the Information Age (found this awesome piece of literature accidentally)\nWon\u0026rsquo;t be going into details of this thing but you can check out this for a proof, or this paper for a more detailed historical outlook to the problem.\n","date":"15 May 2022","permalink":"/til/37percent/","section":"Today I Learned","summary":"An algorithm which answers the ages old question- is he/she the right one for me?","title":"The 37% Rule"},{"content":" So, you thought wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s the god wiki? The history of wikis dates from 1994, when Ward Cunningham invented the concept and gave it its name.

There are only a few games whose physics and mechanics actually make sense.

According to Wikipedia (saving you from that extra tab in your overly crowded chrome :)\nSurvivorship bias, survival bias or immortal time bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to incorrect conclusions.\nI did not realize it until I heard this thing from a friend. In layman terms- we tend to compare our present with the things that made their way in the past, completely ignoring the things which didn\u0026rsquo;t. This in itself is a very poor comparison as nobody\u0026rsquo;s sure about the present.

Original problem statement file and required files here. This problem was given to me in my sophomore year as a task under my tenure in the ARK perception team.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t done robotics in a long while (am writing this thing after leaving all that stuff behind), this being the only testimony of me having done those courses on image processing lol.\nProblem Statement # If none of the following make sense to you and those text files seem like random jargon, this post is NOT for you. Go and move on, you\u0026rsquo;re better off not knowing about all this altogether (unless you want to pursue a career in robotics, maybe)\nA breif version of the problem goes like this-\ngiven 30 files, 10 each of types 0 (RGB, jpg), 1 (Segmentation, jpg) and 2 (Pose, txt) images are 256x144 in size a projective pinhole camera is used everywhere camera has a horizontal field-of-view (FOV) of 90° assumptions- the distortion parameters are zero principal point of the image is at its center focal length in x direction = focal length in y direction pose data is the position of the camera in the world coordinates in the NED coordinate system it is stored in the form of an orientation quaternion and a position vector Objective # Using the information provided, calculate\nlength of the side of the cube x,y,z coordinates of the centroid of the cube WARNING: Proceed ahead only after you\u0026rsquo;re ready for the solution (after giving the problem some thought) and are already familiar with the basics of image processing and Computer Vision Initial Attempt # I started to recall everything that I\u0026rsquo;d gone through while doing my courses. Thought about applying all sorts of stuff like homography, constructing the camera matrices, using stereo pairs (seemed illogical at that time).\nMy line of thought only seemed to go in one direction- use all images separately.\nBut then I hit a dead wall when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t convert the 2D coordiantes to 3D ones (was the essence of the entire problem). I thought maybe the information given was insufficient and I needed a scale factor.\nThe whole 3D -\u0026gt; 2D conversion eats up the depth information completely, hence a (x, y, z) -\u0026gt; (x\u0026rsquo;, y\u0026rsquo;) mapping exists. However to do the opposite, you need to materialize the depth information from somewhere.\nBut then again, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using all the information provided to me, hinting towards my shortcoming.\nMy solution approach # I started to think of some use case to the segmentation masks provided. I had to locate corners in tha image according to image coordiantes. So there it was, I used the segmentation masks, ran them through the Harris corner detector function of OpenCV.\nThe results were good honestly,\nbut\nResult # ","date":"5 March 2022","permalink":"/blog/cv-task/","section":"Blog","summary":"An interesting Computer Vision problem with all my approaches and an elegant solution.","title":"A Computer Vision Problem"},{"content":" Getting things done while procrastinating.

Now let’s start this thing off with a boring-made-up quote\nWhen it comes to building / learning stuff one can never and should never forget the tools which led them to tangible feat. Things get real serious when those tools happen to be the very same dark-shiny-squarish boxes which filled your eyes with a childish glossom (maybe?) when they arrived. (I mean, I have my algorithms lab tomorrow and I’m still writing this blog, c’mon man it’s dead serious)\nJune 2013 # I was in sixth grade when that large alien box arrived. Just like any other kid I was literally jumping to open it up and use it. Yep, am talking ‘bout my first personal computer mate (I was more of a caveman uptill 2013 o_O). And yes the boy sure got a name too. ‘Tis El-Machina but I guess Elmach works as well. I won’t be going too deep into specifications but it is a lenevo product (reliable buckets they produce OwO), an all in one PC which came packed with a shiny Windows 8 as I reckon. I isn’t built for gaming (dude has some intel graphics in the name of gpu) and since it’s an all in one PC I was too scared to upgrade it (plus I didn’t have that elder tech support guy in my family). But I do remember I could play and finish up GTA 5 in it (after making several rounds to — Low Spec Gamer1 xD). Even did all my JEE prep in that rig. I used it majorly for, umm yeah the usual stuff - movies, games, music, pictures, web surfing, literally everything. Ooh by the way, he’s doing just fine today as well. Just some signs of old age (:P). Oooh and btw I recently dual booted Ubuntu 18.04 into him for research purposes (no seriously, for some task in computer vision (man, I’ve been doin too much parenthesization lmao))). So yeah the boy shall play well for some more years.\nNovember 2020 # So I got a new beast girl (yup all desktops are bois and all laptops are gorls, no further discussion). Has been a year and thing’s are going awesome. So she’s from Dell and her name is Electric-Monolith (yeah dass the best I could come up with plis no attaccs) or Elmon (kinda cute :3). So now I do have a decent GPU and do play sometimes (ignoring the fact that most of my time gets eaten up by algo lab :\u0026quot;).
