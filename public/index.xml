      <description>Disclaimer: This post is absolutely not about my butt curves. Now let’s start this thing off with a boring-made-up quote
 When it comes to building / learning stuff one can never and should never forget the tools which led them to tangible feat. Things get real serious when those tools happen to be the very same dark-shiny-squarish boxes which filled your eyes with a childish glossom (maybe?) when they arrived.</description>

      <description>Hi there, you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page. As the title dictates, let me introduce myself. My name is Ashwani Kumar Kamal. I&amp;rsquo;m a second year undergraduate student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in frontend development and have a beginner taste in backend development. I&amp;rsquo;ve done courses on Image processing and Deep Learning.
In my free time you&amp;rsquo;d probably find me watching some anime series.</description>
