      <description>Disclaimer: This post is absolutely not about my butt curves. Now let&amp;rsquo;s start this thing off with a boring-made-up quote

      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Ashwani
I am currently having a one way conversation (textual that too) with the reader / user on this website from some point in past. So basically I&amp;rsquo;m currently a sophomore at IIT Kharagpur enrolled in its B.Tech course majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I have some experience with web development and (at the time of writing this) currently exploring Computer Vision and its application in perception tasks in autonomous robotics.</description>
