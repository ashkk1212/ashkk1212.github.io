I act like normal people, almost everyday but then I relax a bit and do weird stuff. Idk, it feels like I'm the "normal" guy at that time.

## Why are you writing right now?

>Must leave this information, else they won't be able to know. This is our only form of communication. The last hope.

Even I wouldn't expect myself to be this so descriptive lol. That's like too much verbose.

### Whaddup bud?

- Time going very slow, that's like the most obvious of them all i guess.
- Too much reaction to stimuli. Idk how to put it in words but, feels, terrific.
- Hungry, thirsty.
- Memory nhk.
- Easily zone out on large hits / initial ones
- Non boring part stars from here-
  - Appreciation for art
  - You feel creativity (a little too much)
  - Too deep interpolation and introspection of some past / presently past event. I was thinking a lot about 2020 recently. Change of perspective, own opinion, ik ik.
  - Feel like input senses are, are, monocolour?
  - Trying to differentiate between 0 and 1
  - Earlier theory says, both are 1/2.
  - Miss my then self (sem 4). I've changed
  - Lmaooo was thinking the same (sem 4 guy about online sem guy).
  - Just too many Deja Vu's than I can digest.
  - Non chalant behaviour
  - I feel, I will forget about these, but, they are like, very normal things? So, why am I worried? Idk man, feels like the 0 guy will pay no heed to this.
  - Trips?- music trips, road trips, maggu trips?

- Eventually everyting under control.
- Apes together strong
- The box not present, really wrong scale of things, social norms, confusion-
  - Notion of normal things- historical facts and socially accepted acts (are not important)
  - Cannot rely on these to judge my current time.
  - Concept of present- you, are, writing the book. You, are, the new normal.
  - Subjectivity
  - I'll never know if I'm correct or not.

## Review by my other fellows

I just can't generalize. It has to be different, I know it. Like, it feels like an island, too far and too cool. Must drop some good easters down there.
