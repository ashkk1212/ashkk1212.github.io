Ayy, how much for that large bucket over there, sir?
{{< /lead >}}

Classic cringe-full bucket list, will keep updating this.

## To-do-before-graduation

I came to campus in my 4th semester. I don't think I can ever claim that I know my campus in and out (even on my last day here as a student). There's just too many corners and nooks here. The following list doesn't make much sense, but hey, atleast I'll have something to look forward to till then.

- Climb clock tower
- Spend one entire night in Nalanda

## Academic

- Work at an HFT firm
- Get a masters in core CS
- Complete one research program
- Answer 100 questions on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Life

- Get over fear of heights
- Travel around the world
- Try out cuisine of all major countries
- Become a music connoisseur
- Become a tea and coffee connoisseur as well
