How to cliché recipe 101

- make a website using some [SSG](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/performance/static-site-generator/)
- start adding blog posts on it
- talk about pHiLoSoPhY, lIfEsTyLe, lItErAtUrE and mostly non-tech (disguised attempt to gain social points :clown:)
- ![stonk_doge](/stonks_doge.jpg)

(Yup, acting like that cool doge is the final step in the recipe)

*Sighs*, I’ll try my best to make the content a little interesting atleast so please bear with my nagging :x

Also, feel free to comment on any of my blog posts, I'd really appreciate it.
