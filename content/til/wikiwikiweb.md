So, you thought wikipedia's the god wiki?
{{< /lead >}}

The history of wikis dates from 1994, when Ward Cunningham invented the concept and gave it its name. [C2 wiki](http://wiki.c2.com/) thus became the first wiki, or a website with pages that can be edited via the browser by its own target audience, with a version history for each page.

I'm not sure how many people know about this website (barring the veteran software developers ofc), but if you're interested in software design patterns then this website is nothing less than a rollercoaster ride for you. I mean, did you know there's something known as [Pair Programming Ping Pong Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?PairProgrammingPingPongPattern)?

Some of my accidentally-found good topics are-

- [Pattern Index](http://wiki.c2.com/?PatternIndex)
- [AntiPattern Catalog](http://wiki.c2.com/?AntiPatternsCatalog)
- [Code Smell](http://wiki.c2.com/?CodeSmell)
- [Analysis Paralysis](http://wiki.c2.com/?AnalysisParalysis)
- [Big Project Syndrome](http://wiki.c2.com/?BigProjectSyndrome)
- [Programmers Are Wankers](http://wiki.c2.com/?ProgrammersAreWankers)
