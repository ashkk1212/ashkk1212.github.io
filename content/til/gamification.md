That point when game physics make perfect sense.
{{< /lead >}}

There are only a few games whose physics and mechanics actually make sense. Ironically people use it in non game envronments with the objective of increasing prodcutivity and interaction.

Honestly successful gamification has sorta become a standard for comparing things. [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) in education, [Starbucks Rewards](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards) in marketing and [Snapstreak in Snapchat](https://support.snapchat.com/en-GB/a/snapstreaks) are some good examples.

But what about when gamification is applied to life and basic scheduling in routine, *hmm*.
