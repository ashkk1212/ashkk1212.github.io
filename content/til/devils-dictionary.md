Finally some innovation on a dictionary.
{{< /lead >}}

I'm no bibliophile but do appreaciate good writing.  
That is, while looking for another book to add it to my overflowing stack of ```not-gonna-read-but-hey-its-cool-ill-read-afterwards``` list, (a long pause here) I happened to stumble upon this piece of literature.

A satirical dictionary written by American journalist Ambrose Bierce, consisting of common words followed by humorous and satirical definitions, I'd say it is indeed a fine work of art.

Some examples-
>YEAR, n. A period of three hundred and sixty-five disappointments.
>
>DOCTOR, n. A gentleman who thrives upon disease and dies of health.
>
>ENVELOPE, n. The coffin of a document; the scabbard of a bill; the husk of a remittance; the bed-gown of a love-letter.

And ofc, there's a website dedicated to it [here](http://www.thedevilsdictionary.com/) so you can look it up whenever you want.  

Also please do drop in any good satire literary pieces in the comments, I'll gladly take out time to read them.
