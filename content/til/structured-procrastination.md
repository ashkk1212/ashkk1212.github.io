Getting things done while procrastinating.
{{< /lead >}}

There is literally a whole website dedicated to this thing [here](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/).
The footer of the website captures the main idea -
>Site designed by the author's granddaughter, who did the work while avoiding the far more weighty assignment of her literature test.

The concept has major intersection with the [living asynchronously](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea/) idea (do give it a read as well).

The whole thing revolves around getting the low priority things done while you're procrastinating the high priority ones. You might not have realized it but at some point you were procrastinating structurally too. I, too found this website while procrastinating some very important stuff.

Quite creatively you can still get things done while selecting which tasks to assign the high priority. One doesn't need to be the master of their time, but some work done is any day better than no work done.
