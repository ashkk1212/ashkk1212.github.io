Another super fancy term for something I didn't realize I knew until I read about it.

According to Wikipedia (saving you from that extra tab in your overly crowded chrome :)
>Survivorship bias, survival bias or immortal time bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to incorrect conclusions.

I did not realize it until I heard this thing from a friend. In layman terms- we tend to compare our present with the things that made their way in the past, completely ignoring the things which didn't. This in itself is a very poor comparison as nobody's sure about the present. Also comparison is bad boys (unless it is between Admiral Snackbar and Joe ofc) now go and google more about it.
