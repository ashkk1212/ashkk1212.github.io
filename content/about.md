Hi there, you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page. As the title dictates, let me introduce myself. My name is Ashwani Kumar Kamal. I'm a second year undergraduate student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  

I've worked in frontend development and have a beginner taste in backend development. I've done courses on Image processing and Deep Learning.  

In my free time you'd probably find me watching some anime series.   

At the time of writing of this page, I am on [Elmon](https://sneakypotato.live/posts/my-dynamic-duo) running Pop OS
