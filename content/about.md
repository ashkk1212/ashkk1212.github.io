Hi there, you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page.

My name is Ashwani Kumar Kamal. I'm a second year undergraduate student from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.  

I've worked in both frontend and  backend development. I've done courses on Image processing and Deep Learning.  

In my free time you'd probably find me watching some anime series.

At the time of writing of this page, I am on [Elmon](https://sneaky-potato.ml/blog/my-dynamic-duo) running Pop OS
