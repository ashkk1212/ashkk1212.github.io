Hi there, you are currently having a one-sided-textual-probably-monotonous-(tryhard?)-talk with me through this page.

*(Not one-sided anymore, thanks to [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), feel free to comment on this or any of my posts that you find interesting. **Dire** need of some activity here :P)*

My name is **Ashwani Kumar Kamal**. I'm a second year undergraduate student from the department of **Computer Science and Engineering** at **Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur**.  

I've worked in both frontend and  backend development. I've done courses on Image processing and Deep Learning.  

In my free time you'd probably find me watching some anime series or reading some book.

At the time of writing of this page, I am on [Elmon](https://sneaky-potato.ml/blog/my-dynamic-duo) running Pop OS.
